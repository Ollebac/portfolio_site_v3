        <p className={styles.about_text}>
          In 2017, I started my professional career performing internal, IT
          audits where I used my coding knowledge to enhance control testing
          through code inspection. Moving on further into external audit, I
          began to miss the excitement and thrills of creating things through
          coding. In 2021, I restarted my journey of becoming a developer.

        <p className={styles.about_text}>
          While I do have a formal education in Computer Science, all of my web
          development knowledge and skills are self-taught, driven entirely by
          my desire to create things.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.about_text}>
          Outside of dev, I enjoy volunteering in the community through various
          ways including helping at the local animal shelter and being a
          volunteer Firefighter. I also love playing games with my friends,
          going to the gym, and spending time with my fianc√©e and animals (1 dog
          and 3 cats)!
